# Things learned
* Setup with dependencies was extremly hard
* tokio::main is like a hidden initialization, can be done manually (but i don't know how)
* The main function can be also async, thats strange
* await is a keyword, but looks like a private member. Thats very confusing
* Use cargo add to add dependencies, but it doesnt free you from knowing features
* The toml dependency syntax is very confusing, i don't know how to add features
* When i click in VS Code on the await, I  get a function 'poll'. How on earth is this working?
* I simply dont't understand what OK(()) is doing.  Never saw (()) before
*
