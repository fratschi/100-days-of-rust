# About
I'm trying to learn rust within 100 days. My starting point is some
knowledge about programming in the past 20 years with Java and ~3 years with go.

My experience with C and C++ is outdated and I havent't used C or C++ in the past 20 years after finishing university...

I've read a lot about rust but never started to program rust and this
challenge is to flex the muscle memory for the rust syntax.

The order and the topics are propably in a random order. I simply start with the challenge and add topics for the remaining days while I try to solve the problem of the day.

I'm using vscode for rust and github copilot- I hope that github copilot helps and is not preventing me from learing the necessary skills.


## Days


* [Day 1](rust-001/readme.md) - Install and run first example
* [Day 2](rust-002/readme.md) - Write a small program that uses structs
* [Day 3](rust-003/readme.md) - Functions and passing data


* Use Result for returning optional results
* Open a file and iterate over all lines
* Open a yaml and a json file and load it into a struct
* Write a main with a Result
