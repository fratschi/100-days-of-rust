# Thinngs learnded
* The example in https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html doesn't explain enough
* The bin element in the top toml was missing
* When using workspaces, the cargo run needs an argument to specify the binary to run
  * cargo run -p app
* Without pub keyword in the lib create, the functions is not exported/visible
* 

# TODO
* modules are a different thing than workspaces
* still don't unterstand what packages are
